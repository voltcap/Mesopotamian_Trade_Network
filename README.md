The aim of the project is to analyse the distance between the selected city states and identify the key hubs of the Mesopotamian trade network. The cities included Eridu, Ur, Uruk, Nippur, Mari, Assur, Nineveh, Ebla and Kultepe. Each of these cities contributed to the extensive trade network, but the central question is, which cities served as the central hubs of trade?
